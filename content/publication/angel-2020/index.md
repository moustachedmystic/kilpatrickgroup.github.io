abstract: Creating effective and stable catalyst nanoparticle-coated electrodes that
  can withstand extensive cycling is a current roadblock in realising the potential
  of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Graphene has been proposed as an ideal
  electrode support material due to its corrosion resistance, high surface area and
  high conductivity. However, to date, graphene-based electrodes suffer from high
  defect concentrations and non-uniform nanoparticle coverage that negatively affects
  performance; moreover, production methods are difficult to scale. Herein we describe
  a scalable synthesis for Pt nanoparticle-coated graphene whereby PtCl2 is reduced
  directly by negatively charged single layer graphene sheets in solution. The resultant
  nanoparticles are of optimal dimensions and can be uniformly dispersed, yielding
  high catalytic activity, remarkable stability, and showing a much smaller decrease
  in electrochemical surface area compared with an optimised commercial catalyst over
  30 000 cycles. The stability is rationalised by identical location TEM which shows
  minimal nanoparticle agglomeration and no nanoparticle detachment.
