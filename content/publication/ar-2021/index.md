abstract: The heteroleptic (formazanato)nickel bromide complex LNi($μ$-Br)2NiL [LH
  = Mes-NH-N=C(p-tol)-N=N-Mes] has been prepared by deprotonation of LH with NaH followed
  by reaction with NiBr2(dme). Treatment of this complex with KC8 led to transformation
  of the formazanate into azoiminate ligands via N-N bond cleavage and the simultaneous
  release of aniline. At the same time, the potentially resulting intermediate complex
  L′2Ni [L′ = HN=C(p-tol)-N=N-Mes] was reduced by one additional electron, which is
  delocalized across the $π$system and the metal center. The resulting reduced complex
  [L′2Ni]K(18-c-6) has a S = 1/2 ground state and a square-planar structure. It reacts
  with dioxygen via one-electron oxidation to give the complex L′2Ni, and the formation
  of superoxide was detected spectroscopically. If oxidizable substrates are present
  during this process, these are oxygenated/oxidized. Triphenylphosphine is converted
  to phosphine oxide, and hydrogen atoms are abstracted from TEMPO-H and phenols.
  In the case of cyclohexene, autoxidations are triggered, leading to the typical
  radical-chain-derived products of cyclohexene.
