abstract: Professor Geoff Cloke FRS celebrates his 65th birthday in 2018. In a career
  spanning four decades, his research endeavours have accounted for some of the most
  innovative synthetic chemistry of the modern era, with his many publications describing
  truly exceptional compounds and experimental methods that portray a unique chemical
  imagination. In addition to his scientific accomplishments, Cloke can be particularly
  proud of his successful mentoring, a level of dedication that propelled many students
  and post-docs on to become research leaders in their own right. In compiling this
  collection of some of his research articles, a small cross-section of his friends,
  colleagues and collaborators, wish to pay tribute to his modesty, compassion and
  generous personality.
