 abstract = {Abstract Molecular orbital (MO) theory is used to describe the bonding in transition metal pentalene complexes in a variety of its coordination modes. The various MO models account for structural parameters and lead to simple rules for electron counting in pentalene complexes. Recent applications of pentalene complexes are also reviewed, in the areas of small molecule activation and catalysis and as molecular models for conducting organometallic polymers.},
