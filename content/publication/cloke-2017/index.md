abstract: Abstract Molecular orbital (MO) theory is used to describe the bonding in
  transition metal pentalene complexes in a variety of its coordination modes. The
  various MO models account for structural parameters and lead to simple rules for
  electron counting in pentalene complexes. Recent applications of pentalene complexes
  are also reviewed, in the areas of small molecule activation and catalysis and as
  molecular models for conducting organometallic polymers.
