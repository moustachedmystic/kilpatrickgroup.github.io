abstract: 'Carbon dioxide and epoxide copolymerization is an industrially relevant
  means to valorize waste and improve sustainability in polymer manufacturing. Given
  the value of the polymer products—polycarbonates or polyether carbonates—it could
  provide an economic stimulus to capture and storage technologies. The process efficiency
  depends upon the catalyst, and previously Zn(ii)Mg(ii) heterodinuclear catalysts
  showed good performances at low carbon dioxide pressures, attributed to synergic
  interactions between the metals. Now, a Mg(ii)Co(ii) catalyst is reported that exhibits
  significantly better activity (turnover frequency > 12,000 h−1) and high selectivity
  (>99% CO2 utilization and polycarbonate selectivity) for carbon dioxide and cyclohexene
  oxide copolymerization. Detailed kinetic investigations show a second-order rate
  law, independent of CO2 pressure from 1–40 bar, to produce polyols. Kinetic data
  also reveal that synergy arises from differentiated roles for the metals in the
  mechanism: epoxide coordination occurs at Mg(ii), with reduced transition state
  entropy, while the Co(ii) centre accelerates carbonate attack by lowering the transition
  state enthalpy. This rare insight into intermetallic synergy rationalizes the outstanding
  catalytic performance and provides a new feature to exploit in other homogeneous
  catalyses. The copolymerization of CO2 with epoxides is an attractive approach for
  valorizing waste products and improving sustainability in polymer manufacturing.
  Now, a heterodinuclear Mg(ii)Co(ii) complex has been shown to act as a highly active
  and selective catalyst for this reaction at low CO2 pressure. The synergy between
  the two metals was investigated using polymerization kinetics.'
