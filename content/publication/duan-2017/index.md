abstract: Bio-oil, produced by the destructive distillation of cheap and renewable
  lignocellulosic biomass, contains high energy density oligomers in the water-insoluble
  fraction that can be utilized for diesel and valuable fine chemicals productions.
  Here, we show an efficient hydrodeoxygenation catalyst that combines highly dispersed
  palladium and ultrafine molybdenum phosphate nanoparticles on silica. Using phenol
  as a model substrate this catalyst is 100% effective and 97.5% selective for hydrodeoxygenation
  to cyclohexane under mild conditions in a batch reaction; this catalyst also demonstrates
  regeneration ability in long-term continuous flow tests. Detailed investigations
  into the nature of the catalyst show that it combines hydrogenation activity of
  Pd and high density of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites; we believe these are
  key features for efficient catalytic hydrodeoxygenation behavior. Using a wood and
  bark-derived feedstock, this catalyst performs hydrodeoxygenation of lignin, cellulose,
  and hemicellulose-derived oligomers into liquid alkanes with high efficiency and
  yield.
