 abstract = {Rac- and meso-bis(1-hexamethylindenyl)phenylborane zirconium dichloride, rac-, meso-(PhBBI*)ZrCl2 has been synthesised and fully characterised. The slurry phase ethylene polymerisation performance of rac-(PhBBI*)ZrCl2 immobilised on a range of methylaluminoxane (MAO)-modified, solvent-dispersed, high surface area layered double hydroxides (AMO/AIM-MgxAl-CO3 LDHs) have been studied. The polymerisation activities show a strong dependence on the nature of the LDH. Rac-(PhBBI*)ZrCl2 supported on a MAO-modified 1-hexanol dispersed [Mg0.73Al0.27(OH)2][CO3]0.135 LDH displayed a maximum ethylene polymerisation activity of 6641 kgPE molZr−1 h−1 bar−1 at 70 °C and 2 bar ethylene. Benchmarking studies reveal that some of the rac-(PhBBI*)ZrCl2 supported catalysts outperform a range of commonly used industrial metallocene PE catalysts.},
