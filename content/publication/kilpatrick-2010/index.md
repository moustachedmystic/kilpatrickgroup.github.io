abstract: Reaction of (Me(2)pz)(2)CHSiMe(2)N(H)R (R = (i)Pr or Ph) or (Me(2)pz)(2)CHSiMe(2)NMe(2)
  with CrCl(3)(THF)(3) or CrCl(2)(THF)(2) gave Cr(Me(2)pz)(2)CHSiMe(2)NR(1)R(2)Cl(3)
  (R(1) = H, R(2) = (i)Pr (10) or Ph (11); R(1) = R(2) = Me (15)) or Cr(Me(2)pz)(2)CHSiMe(2)NR(1)R(2)Cl(2)(THF)
  (R(1) = H, R(2) = (i)Pr (12) or Ph (13); R(1) = R(2) = Me (16)), respectively. Compounds
  10 and 11 were crystallographically characterized and the magnetic behaviour of
  all the new compounds was evaluated using SQUID magnetometry. Reaction of CrCl(3)(THF)(3)
  with LiC(Me(2)pz)(3)(THF) gave the zwitterionic complex CrC(Me(2)pz)(3)Cl(2)(THF)
  (17) containing an apical carbanion. Reaction of the analogous phenol-based ligand
  (Me(2)pz)(2)CHArOH (ArO = 2-O-3,5-C(6)H(2)(t)Bu(2)) with CrCl(3)(THF)(3) gave Cr(Me(2)pz)(2)CHArOHCl(3)
  (19) whereas the corresponding reaction with CrCl(2)(THF)(2) unexpectedly gave the
  Cr(III) phenolate derivative Cr(Me(2)pz)(2)CHArOCl(2)(THF) (20) which could also
  be prepared from CrCl(3)(THF)(3) and the sodiated ligand [Na(Me(2)pz)(2)CHArO(THF)](2).
  Reaction of the corresponding ether (Me(2)pz)(2)CHArOMe with CrCl(3)(THF)(3) or
  CrCl(2)(THF)(2) gave Cr(Me(2)pz)(2)CHArOMeCl(3) (23) and Cr(Me(2)pz)(2)CHArOMeCl(2)(THF)
  (24), respectively. The catalytic performance in ethylene oligomerisation/polymerisation
  of all of the new Cr(II) and Cr(III) complexes was evaluated. Most of the complexes
  showed high activity, but produced a Schultz-Flory distribution of alpha-olefins.
  Compound 23 had an exceptionally low alpha-value of 0.37 and showed a preference
  for 1-hexene and 1-octene formation. While replacing a secondary amine (10-13) for
  a tertiary amine (15-16) resulted in loss of catalytic activity, replacing a phenol
  (19) for an anisole (23) group afforded a more selective and more active catalyst.
  Changing from MAO to DIBAL-O as cocatalyst induced a switch in selectivity to ethylene
  polymerisation.
