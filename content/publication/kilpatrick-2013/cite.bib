 abstract = {The novel bimetallic bis(pentalene) complex Ti2($μ$:$η$5,$η$5-Pn†)2 (Pn† = C8H4(SiiPr3-1,4)2) has been synthesised and structurally characterised. Structural data show a Ti-Ti distance of 2.399(2) å, consistent with a strong metal-metal interaction, which DFT calculations best describe as a double bond with $σ$ and $π$ components. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},
