abstract: The novel bimetallic bis(pentalene) complex Ti2($μ$:$η$5,$η$5-Pn†)2 (Pn†
  = C8H4(SiiPr3-1,4)2) has been synthesised and structurally characterised. Structural
  data show a Ti-Ti distance of 2.399(2) å, consistent with a strong metal-metal interaction,
  which DFT calculations best describe as a double bond with $σ$ and $π$ components.
