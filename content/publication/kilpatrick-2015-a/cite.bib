 abstract = {The reactivity of the di-titanium bis(pentalene) double-sandwich compound (Pn†)2Ti2 (1), Pn† = [C8H4SiiPr3-1,42], with CO2 is investigated in detail using spectroscopic, X-ray crystallographic, and computational studies. When the CO2 reaction is performed at -78 °C a 1:1 adduct 4 is formed, and low temperature spectroscopic measurements are consistent with a CO2 molecule bound symmetrically between two Ti centres in a $μ$:$η$2,$η$2- binding mode, a structure also indicated by theory. Upon warming to room temperature the coordinated CO2 is quantitatively reduced over a period of minutes, to give a bis(oxo) bridged dimer 2 and the dicarbonyl complex 3. In situ NMR studies indicate this decomposition proceeds in a stepwise process via mono(oxo) (5) and monocarbonyl (7) double-sandwich complexes, which have been independently synthesised and structurally characterised. 5 is thermally unstable with respect to a $μ$-O dimer in which the Ti−Ti bond has been cleaved and the pentalene ligands bind in an $η$8- fashion to each formally TiIII centre. The molecular structure of 7 shows a 'side-on' bound carbonyl ligand. Bonding of the double-sandwich species Pn2Ti2, Pn = [C8H6] to other fragments has been investigated by density functional calculations and fragment analysis, and provides insight into the CO2 reaction pathway consistent with the experimentally observed intermediates. A key step in the proposed mechanism is disproportionation of di-TiIII mono(oxo) species to yield di-TiII and di-TiIV products. 1 forms a structurally characterised, thermally stable CS2 adduct 8, which shows symmetrical binding to the Ti2 unit and supports the formulation of 4. The reaction of 1 with COS forms a thermally unstable 9 which undergoes scission to a mono($μ$-S) mono(CO) species 10. Ph3PS is an effective sulfur transfer agent for 1, enabling the synthesis of mono($μ$-S) complex 11 with a double-sandwich structure, and bis($μ$-S) dimer 12 in which the Ti−Ti bond has been cleaved.},
