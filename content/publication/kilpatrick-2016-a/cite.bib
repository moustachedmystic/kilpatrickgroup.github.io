 abstract = {An insoluble form of methylaluminoxane, also known as solid polymethylaluminoxane (sMAO), has been synthesized by the controlled hydrolysis of tri-methylaluminum (TMA) with benzoic acid, followed by thermolysis. Characterization of sMAO by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy in solution and the solid state reveals a dynamic aluminoxane structure that features “free” and bound TMA and incorporation of a benzoate resi-due. The pair distribution function (PDF) computed from the corrected total X-ray scattering of sMAO in comparision to DFT modeled structures indicates a nanotubular Al12O9Me18 core structure is most likely. The measured N2 Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) sur-face area of sMAO ranges between 9 - 16 m2 mmolAl–1 and show Type II isotherm N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. sMAO can be utilized to support metallocene pre-catalysts in slurry-phase ethylene polymerization reactions. Metallocene pre-catalyst rac-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)-dichlorozirconium, (EBI)ZrCl2 was immobilized on sMAO samples, to afford solids which showed very high polymerization activities in hexane, comparable to those of the respective homogeneous catalysts formed by treatment of the pre-catalysts with MAO. (EBI)ZrCl2 immobilized on an sMAO containing an Al:O ratio of 1.2 gave the highest ethylene polymerization activity.},
