abstract: An insoluble form of methylaluminoxane, also known as solid polymethylaluminoxane
  (sMAO), has been synthesized by the controlled hydrolysis of tri-methylaluminum
  (TMA) with benzoic acid, followed by thermolysis. Characterization of sMAO by multinuclear
  NMR spectroscopy in solution and the solid state reveals a dynamic aluminoxane structure
  that features “free” and bound TMA and incorporation of a benzoate resi-due. The
  pair distribution function (PDF) computed from the corrected total X-ray scattering
  of sMAO in comparision to DFT modeled structures indicates a nanotubular Al12O9Me18
  core structure is most likely. The measured N2 Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) sur-face
  area of sMAO ranges between 9 - 16 m2 mmolAl–1 and show Type II isotherm N2 adsorption/desorption
  isotherms. sMAO can be utilized to support metallocene pre-catalysts in slurry-phase
  ethylene polymerization reactions. Metallocene pre-catalyst rac-ethylenebis(1-indenyl)-dichlorozirconium,
  (EBI)ZrCl2 was immobilized on sMAO samples, to afford solids which showed very high
  polymerization activities in hexane, comparable to those of the respective homogeneous
  catalysts formed by treatment of the pre-catalysts with MAO. (EBI)ZrCl2 immobilized
  on an sMAO containing an Al:O ratio of 1.2 gave the highest ethylene polymerization
  activity.
