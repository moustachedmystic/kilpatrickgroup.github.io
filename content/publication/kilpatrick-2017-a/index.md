abstract: The reactivity of the Ti=Ti double bond in ($μ$:$η$5,$η$5-Pn†)2Ti2 (1),
  Pn† = 1,4-SiiPr32C8H4 towards isocyanide and heteroallene substrates, and molecules
  featuring homonuclear bonds between main group elements (E−E) has been explored.
  Reaction of 1 with methylisocyanide or1,3-N,N'-di-p-tolylcarbodiimide resulted in
  the formation of 1:1 adducts, ($μ$:$η$5,$η$5-Pn†)2Ti2($μ$:$η$2-CNMe) (2) and ($μ$:$η$5,$η$5-Pn†)2Ti2($μ$-CN(4-C6H4CH3)2)
  (3) respectively, which are thermally stable up to 100 °C in contrast to the analogous
  adducts formed with CO and CO2. Reaction of 1 with phenylisocyanate afforded a paramagnetic
  complex, [($η$8-Pn†)Ti]2($μ$-$ąppa$2:$p̨pa$2-O2CNPh) (4), in which the ‘double-sandwich'
  architecture of 1 has been broken and an unusual phenyl-carbonimidate ligand bridges
  two formally Ti(III) centres. Reaction of 1 with diphenyl dichalcogenides, Ph2E2
  (E = S, Se and Te) led to a series of Ti−Ti single bonded complexes ($μ$:$η$5,$η$5-Pn†)2[Ti(EPh)]2
  E = S (5), Se (6) and Te (7), which can be considered the result of a 2e− redox
  reaction or a 1,2 addition across the Ti=Ti bond. Treatment of 1 with azobenzene
  or phenylazide afforded [($η$8-Pn†)Ti]2($μ$-NPh)2 (8), a bridging-imido complex
  in which the pentalene ligands bind in an $η$8-fashion to each formally Ti(IV) centre,
  as the result of a 4e− redox reaction driven by the oxidative cleavage of the Ti=Ti
  double bond. The new complexes 2−8 were extensively characterised by various techniques
  including multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction, and
  the experimental work was complemented by density functional theory (DFT) studies.
