abstract: We report the synthesis and structural characterisation of three homobimetallic
  complexes featuring divalent lanthanide metals (Ln = Yb, Eu and Sm) bridged by the
  silylated pentalene ligand [1,4-SiiPr32C8H4]2- (= Pn[dagger]). Magnetic measurements
  and cyclic voltammetry have been used to investigate the extent of intermetallic
  communication in these systems, in the context of molecular models for organolanthanide
  based conducting materials.
