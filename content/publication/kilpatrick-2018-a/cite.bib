 abstract = {Post synthesis modification of solid polymethylaluminoxane (sMAO) with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane or pentafluorophenol produces highly active metallocene supports “sMMAOs” for use in slurry-phase ethylene polymerization. Characterization of the sMMAOs using ICP-MS analysis, BET isotherm, SEM-EDX, diffuse FT-IR and solid state NMR spectroscopy reveals that the surface methyl groups are exchanged for C6F5 and C6F5O moieties respectively, giving a material with reduced aluminum content and a lower specific surface area than sMAO. Rac-ethylenebis(1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride, (EBI)ZrCl2 immobilized on B(C6F5)3 and C6F5OH modified sMAO displayed activity increases of 66 and 71% respectively for ethylene polymerization compared to the same zirconocene catalyst precursor on unmodified sMAO. In the case of B(C6F5)3 modified sMAO this enhanced polymerization activity is accompanied by excellent control of polymer particle size and morphology, and a small decrease in polymer molecular weight and polydispersities.},
