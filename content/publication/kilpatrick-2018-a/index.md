abstract: Post synthesis modification of solid polymethylaluminoxane (sMAO) with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane
  or pentafluorophenol produces highly active metallocene supports “sMMAOs” for use
  in slurry-phase ethylene polymerization. Characterization of the sMMAOs using ICP-MS
  analysis, BET isotherm, SEM-EDX, diffuse FT-IR and solid state NMR spectroscopy
  reveals that the surface methyl groups are exchanged for C6F5 and C6F5O moieties
  respectively, giving a material with reduced aluminum content and a lower specific
  surface area than sMAO. Rac-ethylenebis(1-indenyl) zirconium dichloride, (EBI)ZrCl2
  immobilized on B(C6F5)3 and C6F5OH modified sMAO displayed activity increases of
  66 and 71% respectively for ethylene polymerization compared to the same zirconocene
  catalyst precursor on unmodified sMAO. In the case of B(C6F5)3 modified sMAO this
  enhanced polymerization activity is accompanied by excellent control of polymer
  particle size and morphology, and a small decrease in polymer molecular weight and
  polydispersities.
