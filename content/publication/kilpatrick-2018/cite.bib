 abstract = {The pentalene-ligated dysprosium complex [([small eta]8-Pn[dagger])Dy(Cp*)] (1Dy) (Pn[dagger] = [1,4-(iPr3Si)2C8H4]2-) and its magnetically dilute analogue are single-molecule magnets, with energy barriers of 245 cm-1. Whilst the [Cp*]- ligand in 1Dy provides a strong axial crystal field, the overall axiality of this system is attenuated by the unusual folded structure of the [Pn[dagger]]2- ligand.},
