abstract: The pentalene-ligated dysprosium complex [([small eta]8-Pn[dagger])Dy(Cp*)]
  (1Dy) (Pn[dagger] = [1,4-(iPr3Si)2C8H4]2-) and its magnetically dilute analogue
  are single-molecule magnets, with energy barriers of 245 cm-1. Whilst the [Cp*]-
  ligand in 1Dy provides a strong axial crystal field, the overall axiality of this
  system is attenuated by the unusual folded structure of the [Pn[dagger]]2- ligand.
