abstract: Physicochemical surface-structure studies of highly active slurry-phase
  ethylene polymerisation catalysts has been performed. Zirconocene complexes immobilised
  on solid polymethylaluminoxane (sMAO) (sMAO–Cp2ZrX2), have been investigated using
  SEM-EDX, diffuse reflectance FT-IR (DRIFT) and high field (21.1 T) solid state NMR
  (ssNMR) spectroscopy. The data suggest a common surface-bound cationic methylzirconocene
  is the catalytically active species. 91Zr solid sate NMR spectra of sMAO–Cp2ZrCl2
  and sMAO–Cp2ZrMe2 are consistent with a common surface-bound Zr environment. However,
  variation of the $σ$-donor (X) groups on the metallocene precatalyst leads to significant
  differences in polymerisation activity. We report evidence for X group transfer
  from the precatalyst complex onto the surface of the aluminoxane support, which
  in the case of X = C6F5, results in a 38% increase in activity.
