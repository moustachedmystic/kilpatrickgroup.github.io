abstract: Organometallic complexes containing the 5-membered rings cyclopentadienyl
  or phospholyl as $π$-ligands (so-called metallocene complexes) with group 4 metals
  have been investigated for several decades with a sustained effort in the scientific
  community. Titanium, zirconium and hafnium compounds containing one, or two Cp rings
  (“half-sandwich” or “sandwich” complexes, respectively) and their phospholyl analogues
  have witnessed a widespread use in many application areas including organic synthesis,
  homogeneous catalysis and material science. The last two decades have seen a significant
  development of this research field, with new classes of sandwich and half-sandwich
  complex emerging, and particular applications in small molecule activation, dehydrocoupling
  reactions and polymerization catalysis. This article gives a detailed account of
  the research into cyclopentadienyl and phospholyl complexes with group 4 metals
  (Ti, Zr and Hf) over the period 2000–2020.
