abstract: 'Structural adhesives are commonly used to join dissimilar materials and
  are of particular interest in complex technological devices used in automotive,
  telecommunications, photonic devices, aerospace and sustainable power production
  and storage. Their strength, ease of application and stability are of significant
  help in the manufacture and service of the device, however, they can present significant
  issues at end of life, particularly when technology critical metals need to be recovered.
  In this paper, we highlight some of the issues, and discuss an alternative approach:
  the use of adhesives that can be debonded upon application of an external stimulus.
  The aim of this critical review is to consider the polymer systems which have been
  investigated and suggest some alternative strategies. It also aims to demonstrate
  the different stimuli that can be used to debond and critique the applicability
  of these with a number of case studies. Finally, the service conditions and process
  economics are considered together with a discussion of the Green benefits of this
  type of methodology.'
