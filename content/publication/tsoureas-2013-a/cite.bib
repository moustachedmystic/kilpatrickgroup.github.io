 abstract = {The facile two-electron reduction of the phosphaalkyne tBuCP by the U-III cyclopentadienyl-pentalene mixed-sandwich complex [U((5)-C5Me5)(8)-C8H4(SiiPr(3))(2)] is reported. A single-crystal X-ray structural analysis of the diuranium(IV) product [(U(5)-C5Me5(8)-C8H4(SiiPr(3))(2))(2)(-tBuCP)] shows that it contains a slightly unsymmetrical, bridging -(2):(1)-ligated phosphaalkene dianion.},
