 abstract = {The synthesis and molecular structures of a range of uranium(III) mixed sandwich complexes of the type [U([small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2)([small eta]5-CpMe4R)] (R= Me, Et, iPr, tBu,) and their reactivity towards CO2 are reported. The nature of the R group on the cyclopentadienyl ring in the former has a significant effect on the outcome of CO2 activation: when R=Me, the products are the bridging oxo complex U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe5)2([small mu ]-O) and the bridging oxalate complex U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe5)2([small mu ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]2-C2O4); for R= Et or iPr, bridging carbonate U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe4R)2([small mu ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]1-CO3) and bridging oxalate complexes U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe4R)2([small mu ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]2-C2O4) are formed in both cases; and when R= tBu the sole product is the bridging carbonate complex U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe4tBu)2([small mu ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]1-CO3). Electrochemical studies on both the uranium(III) complexes and the dimeric uranium(IV) CO2 reduction products have been carried out and all exhibit quasi reversible redox processes; in particular, the similarities in the U(III)/U(IV) redox couples suggest that the selectivity in the outcome of CO2 reductive activation by these complexes is steric in origin rather than electronic. The latter conclusion is supported by a detailed computational DFT study on the potential mechanistic pathways for reduction of CO2 by this system.},
