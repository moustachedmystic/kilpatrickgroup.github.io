abstract: 'The synthesis and molecular structures of a range of uranium(III) mixed
  sandwich complexes of the type [U([small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2)([small eta]5-CpMe4R)]
  (R= Me, Et, iPr, tBu,) and their reactivity towards CO2 are reported. The nature
  of the R group on the cyclopentadienyl ring in the former has a significant effect
  on the outcome of CO2 activation: when R=Me, the products are the bridging oxo complex
  U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe5)2([small mu ]-O) and the bridging
  oxalate complex U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe5)2([small mu
  ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]2-C2O4); for R= Et or iPr, bridging carbonate U[[small
  eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe4R)2([small mu ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]1-CO3)
  and bridging oxalate complexes U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe4R)2([small
  mu ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]2-C2O4) are formed in both cases; and when R= tBu the
  sole product is the bridging carbonate complex U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small
  eta]5-CpMe4tBu)2([small mu ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]1-CO3). Electrochemical studies
  on both the uranium(III) complexes and the dimeric uranium(IV) CO2 reduction products
  have been carried out and all exhibit quasi reversible redox processes; in particular,
  the similarities in the U(III)/U(IV) redox couples suggest that the selectivity
  in the outcome of CO2 reductive activation by these complexes is steric in origin
  rather than electronic. The latter conclusion is supported by a detailed computational
  DFT study on the potential mechanistic pathways for reduction of CO2 by this system.'
