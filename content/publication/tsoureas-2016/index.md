abstract: The synthesis and molecular structures of a U(V) neutral terminal oxo complex
  and a U(V) sodium uranium nitride contact ion pair are described. The synthesis
  of the former is achieved by the use of tBuNCO as a mild oxygen transfer reagent,
  whilst that of the latter is via the reduction of NaN3. Both mono-uranium complexes
  are stabilised by the presence of bulky silyl substituents on the ligand framework
  that facilitate a 2e- oxidation of a single U(III) centre. In contrast, when steric
  hindrance around the metal centre is reduced by the use of less bulky silyl groups,
  the products are di-uranium, U(IV) bridging oxo and (anionic) nitride complexes,
  resulting from 1e- oxidations of two U(III) centres. SQUID magnetometry supports
  the formal oxidation states of the reported complexes. Electrochemical studies show
  that the U(V) terminal oxo complex can be reduced and the [U(IV)O]- anion was accessed
  via reduction with K/Hg, and structurally characterised. Both the nitride complexes
  display complex electrochemical behaviour but each exhibits a quasi-reversible oxidation
  at ca. -1.6 V vs Fc+/0.
