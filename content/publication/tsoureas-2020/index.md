abstract: The reaction of the uranium(III) complex [U($η$8-Pn††)($η$5-Cp*)] (1) (Pn††
  = C8H4(1,4-SiiPr3)2, Cp* = C5Me5) with ethene at atmospheric pressure produces the
  ethene-bridged di-uranium complex [($η$8-Pn††)($η$5-Cp*)2U($μ$:$η$2:$η$2-C2H4)]
  (2). A computational analysis of 2 reveals that coordination of ethene to uranium
  reduces the carbon-carbon bond order from two to a value consistent with a single
  bond, with a concomitant change in the formal uranium oxidation state from +3 in
  1 to +4 in 2. Fur-thermore, the uranium-ethene bonding in 2 is of the $δ$-type,
  with the dominant uranium contribution being from f/d hybrid orbitals. Complex 2
  reacts with hydrogen to produce ethane and re-form 1, leading to the discovery that
  complex 1 also catalyzes the hydrogenation of ethene under ambient conditions.
