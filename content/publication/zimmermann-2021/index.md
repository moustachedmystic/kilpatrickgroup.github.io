abstract: Reduction of -diketiminato nickel(II) complexes (LtBuNiII) to the corresponding
  nickel(I) compounds does not require alkali metal compounds but can also be performed
  with the milder cobaltocenes. LtBuNiBr and Cp2Co have rather similar redox potentials,
  so that the equilibrium with the corresponding electron transfer compound [LtBuNiIBr][Cp2CoIII]
  (ETC) clearly lies on the side of the starting materials. Still, the ETC portion
  can be used to activate CO2 yielding a mononuclear nickel(II) carbonate complex
  and ETC can be isolated almost quantitatively from the solutions through crystallisation.
  The more negative reduction potential of Cp*2Co shifts the equilibrium formed with
  LtBuNiBr strongly towards the ETC and accordingly the reaction of such solutions
  with CO2 is much faster.
