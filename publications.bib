Compounds 10 and 11 were crystallographically characterized and the magnetic behaviour of all the new compounds was evaluated using SQUID magnetometry. Reaction of CrCl(3)(THF)(3) with Li{C(Me(2)pz)(3)}(THF) gave the zwitterionic complex Cr{C(Me(2)pz)(3)}Cl(2)(THF) (17) containing an apical carbanion. Reaction of the analogous phenol-based ligand (Me(2)pz)(2)CHArOH (ArO = 2-O-3,5-C(6)H(2)(t)Bu(2)) with CrCl(3)(THF)(3) gave Cr{(Me(2)pz)(2)CHArOH}Cl(3) (19) whereas the corresponding reaction with CrCl(2)(THF)(2) unexpectedly gave the Cr(III) phenolate derivative Cr{(Me(2)pz)(2)CHArO}Cl(2)(THF) (20) which could also be prepared from CrCl(3)(THF)(3) and the sodiated ligand [Na{(Me(2)pz)(2)CHArO}(THF)](2). Reaction of the corresponding ether (Me(2)pz)(2)CHArOMe with CrCl(3)(THF)(3) or CrCl(2)(THF)(2) gave Cr{(Me(2)pz)(2)CHArOMe}Cl(3) (23) and Cr{(Me(2)pz)(2)CHArOMe}Cl(2)(THF) (24), respectively. The catalytic performance in ethylene oligomerisation/polymerisation of all of the new Cr(II) and Cr(III) complexes was evaluated. Most of the complexes showed high activity, but produced a Schultz-Flory distribution of alpha-olefins. Compound 23 had an exceptionally low alpha-value of 0.37 and showed a preference for 1-hexene and 1-octene formation. While replacing a secondary amine (10-13) for a tertiary amine (15-16) resulted in loss of catalytic activity, replacing a phenol (19) for an anisole (23) group afforded a more selective and more active catalyst. Changing from MAO to DIBAL-O as cocatalyst induced a switch in selectivity to ethylene polymerisation.},

The nature of the R group on the cyclopentadienyl ring in the former has a significant effect on the outcome of CO2 activation: when R=Me, the products are the bridging oxo complex U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe5)2([small mu ]-O) and the bridging oxalate complex U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe5)2([small mu ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]2-C2O4); for R= Et or iPr, bridging carbonate U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe4R)2([small mu ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]1-CO3) and bridging oxalate complexes U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe4R)2([small mu ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]2-C2O4) are formed in both cases; and when R= tBu the sole product is the bridging carbonate complex U[[small eta]8-C8H6(1,4-SiMe3)2]([small eta]5-CpMe4tBu)2([small mu ]-[small eta]2:[small eta]1-CO3). Electrochemical studies on both the uranium(III) complexes and the dimeric uranium(IV) CO2 reduction products have been carried out and all exhibit quasi reversible redox processes; in particular, the similarities in the U(III)/U(IV) redox couples suggest that the selectivity in the outcome of CO2 reductive activation by these complexes is steric in origin rather than electronic. The latter conclusion is supported by a detailed computational DFT study on the potential mechanistic pathways for reduction of CO2 by this system.},

abstract = {Bonding in the bis(pentalene)dititanium "double-sandwich" species Ti(2)Pn(2) (Pn = C8H6) and its interaction with other fragments have been investigated by density functional calculations and fragment analysis. Ti(2)Pn(2) with C-2v symmetry has two metal-metal bonds and a low-lying metal-based empty orbital, all three frontier orbitals having a(1) symmetry. The latter may be regarded as being derived by symmetric combinations of the classic three frontier orbitals of two bent bis(cyclopentadienyl) metal fragments. Electro-chemical studies on Ti(2)Pn(2)(dagger) (Pn(dagger) =1,4-{(SiPr3)-Pr-i}(2)C8H4) revealed a one-electron oxidation, and the formally mixed-valence Ti(II)-Ti(III) cationic complex [Ti(2)Pn(2)(dagger)] [B(C6F5)(4)] has been structurally characterized. Theory indicates an S = 1/2 ground-state electronic configuration for the latter, which was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry. Carbon dioxide binds symmetrically to Ti(2)Pn(2), preserving the C-2v symmetry, as does carbon disulfide. The dominant interaction in Ti(2)Pn(2)CO(2) is sigma donation into the LUMO of bent CO2, and donation from the O atoms to Ti(2)Pn(2) is minimal, whereas in Ti(2)Pn(2)CS(2) there is significant interaction with the S atoms. The bridging O atom in the mono(oxo) species Ti(2)Pn(2)O, however, employs all three O 2p orbitals in binding and competes strongly with Pn, leading to weaker binding of the carbocyclic ligand, and the sulfur analogue Ti(2)Pn(2)S behaves similarly. Ti(2)Pn(2) is also capable of binding one, two, or three molecules of carbon monoxide. The bonding demands of a single CO molecule are incompatible with symmetric binding, and an asymmetric structure is found. The dicarbonyl adduct Ti(2)Pn(2)(CO)(2) has C-5 symmetry with the Ti2Pn2 unit acting as two MCp2 fragments. Synthetic studies showed that in the presence of excess CO the tricarbonyl complex Ti(2)Pn(2)(dagger)(CO)(3) is formed, which optimizes to an asymmetric structure with one semibridging and two terminal CO ligands. Low-temperature C-13 NMR spectroscopy revealed a rapid dynamic exchange between the two bound CO sites and free CO.},

abstract = {The reactivity of the di-titanium bis(pentalene) double-sandwich compound (Pn†)2Ti2 (1), Pn† = [C8H4{SiiPr3-1,4}2], with CO2 is investigated in detail using spectroscopic, X-ray crystallographic, and computational studies. When the CO2 reaction is performed at -78 °C a 1:1 adduct 4 is formed, and low temperature spectroscopic measurements are consistent with a CO2 molecule bound symmetrically between two Ti centres in a $\mu$:$\eta$2,$\eta$2- binding mode, a structure also indicated by theory. Upon warming to room temperature the coordinated CO2 is quantitatively reduced over a period of minutes, to give a bis(oxo) bridged dimer 2 and the dicarbonyl complex 3. In situ NMR studies indicate this decomposition proceeds in a stepwise process via mono(oxo) (5) and monocarbonyl (7) double-sandwich complexes, which have been independently synthesised and structurally characterised. 5 is thermally unstable with respect to a $\mu$-O dimer in which the Ti−Ti bond has been cleaved and the pentalene ligands bind in an $\eta$8- fashion to each formally TiIII centre. The molecular structure of 7 shows a 'side-on' bound carbonyl ligand. Bonding of the double-sandwich species Pn2Ti2, Pn = [C8H6] to other fragments has been investigated by density functional calculations and fragment analysis, and provides insight into the CO2 reaction pathway consistent with the experimentally observed intermediates. A key step in the proposed mechanism is disproportionation of di-TiIII mono(oxo) species to yield di-TiII and di-TiIV products. 1 forms a structurally characterised, thermally stable CS2 adduct 8, which shows symmetrical binding to the Ti2 unit and supports the formulation of 4. The reaction of 1 with COS forms a thermally unstable 9 which undergoes scission to a mono($\mu$-S) mono(CO) species 10. Ph3PS is an effective sulfur transfer agent for 1, enabling the synthesis of mono($\mu$-S) complex 11 with a double-sandwich structure, and bis($\mu$-S) dimer 12 in which the Ti−Ti bond has been cleaved.},

abstract = {The synthesis and molecular structures of a U(V) neutral terminal oxo complex and a U(V) sodium uranium nitride contact ion pair are described. The synthesis of the former is achieved by the use of tBuNCO as a mild oxygen transfer reagent, whilst that of the latter is via the reduction of NaN3. Both mono-uranium complexes are stabilised by the presence of bulky silyl substituents on the ligand framework that facilitate a 2e- oxidation of a single U(III) centre. In contrast, when steric hindrance around the metal centre is reduced by the use of less bulky silyl groups, the products are di-uranium, U(IV) bridging oxo and (anionic) nitride complexes, resulting from 1e- oxidations of two U(III) centres. SQUID magnetometry supports the formal oxidation states of the reported complexes. Electrochemical studies show that the U(V) terminal oxo complex can be reduced and the [U(IV)O]- anion was accessed via reduction with K/Hg, and structurally characterised. Both the nitride complexes display complex electrochemical behaviour but each exhibits a quasi-reversible oxidation at ca. -1.6 V vs Fc+/0.},

Using phenol as a model substrate this catalyst is 100% effective and 97.5% selective for hydrodeoxygenation to cyclohexane under mild conditions in a batch reaction; this catalyst also demonstrates regeneration ability in long-term continuous flow tests. Detailed investigations into the nature of the catalyst show that it combines hydrogenation activity of Pd and high density of both Br{\o}nsted and Lewis acid sites; we believe these are key features for efficient catalytic hydrodeoxygenation behavior.

Here we report that the surface hydroxyl concentration can be controlled by thermal treatment of these materials under vacuum leading to hydroxyl numbers ($\alpha$OH) similar to that of dehydroxylated silica, alumina and magnesium hydroxide. Thermal treatment of [Mg0.74Al0.26(OH)2](SO4)0.1(CO3)0.03{\textperiodcentered}0.62(H2O){\textperiodcentered}0.04(acetone) prepared by the aqueous miscible organic solvent treatment method (Mg2.84Al-SO4¬ A AMO LDH) is shown to yield a mixed metal oxide above 300 °C by a combination of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), BET surface area analysis and FTIR spectroscopy. PXRD shows the disappearance of the characteristic LDH 00l peaks at 300 °C indicative of decomposition to the layered structure, coupled with a large increase in the BET surface area (95 vs 158 m2 g−1 from treatment at 275 and 300 °C respectively). Titration of the surface hydroxyls with Mg(CH2Ph)2(THF)2 indicates that the hydroxyl number is independent of surface area for a given treatment temperature. Treatment at 450 °C under vacuum produces a mixed metal oxide material with a surface hydroxyl concentration ($\alpha$OH) of 2.14 OH nm−2 similar to the hydroxyl number ($\alpha$OH) of 1.80 OH nm−2 for a sample of SiO2 dehydroxylated at 500 °C. These materials appear to be suitable candidates for use as single-site organometallic catalyst supports.},

Reaction of 1 with methylisocyanide or1,3-N,N'-di-p-tolylcarbodiimide resulted in the formation of 1:1 adducts, ($\mu$:$\eta$5,$\eta$5-Pn†)2Ti2($\mu$:$\eta$2-CNMe) (2) and ($\mu$:$\eta$5,$\eta$5-Pn†)2Ti2($\mu$-C{N(4-C6H4CH3)}2) (3) respectively, which are thermally stable up to 100 °C in contrast to the analogous adducts formed with CO and CO2. Reaction of 1 with phenylisocyanate afforded a paramagnetic complex, [($\eta$8-Pn†)Ti]2($\mu$-$\kappa$2:$\kappa$2-O2CNPh) (4), in which the ‘double-sandwich' architecture of 1 has been broken and an unusual phenyl-carbonimidate ligand bridges two formally Ti(III) centres.

Treatment of 1 with azobenzene or phenylazide afforded [($\eta$8-Pn†)Ti]2($\mu$-NPh)2 (8), a bridging-imido complex in which the pentalene ligands bind in an $\eta$8-fashion to each formally Ti(IV) centre, as the result of a 4e− redox reaction driven by the oxidative cleavage of the Ti=Ti double bond. The new complexes 2−8 were extensively characterised by various techniques including multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction, and the experimental work was complemented by density functional theory (DFT) studies.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide and epoxide copolymerization is an industrially relevant means to valorize waste and improve sustainability in polymer manufacturing. Given the value of the polymer products—polycarbonates or polyether carbonates—it could provide an economic stimulus to capture and storage technologies. The process efficiency depends upon the catalyst, and previously Zn(ii)Mg(ii) heterodinuclear catalysts showed good performances at low carbon dioxide pressures, attributed to synergic interactions between the metals. Now, a Mg(ii)Co(ii) catalyst is reported that exhibits significantly better activity (turnover frequency > 12,000 h−1) and high selectivity (>99% CO2 utilization and polycarbonate selectivity) for carbon dioxide and cyclohexene oxide copolymerization. Detailed kinetic investigations show a second-order rate law, independent of CO2 pressure from 1–40 bar, to produce polyols. Kinetic data also reveal that synergy arises from differentiated roles for the metals in the mechanism: epoxide coordination occurs at Mg(ii), with reduced transition state entropy, while the Co(ii) centre accelerates carbonate attack by lowering the transition state enthalpy. This rare insight into intermetallic synergy rationalizes the outstanding catalytic performance and provides a new feature to exploit in other homogeneous catalyses. The copolymerization of CO2 with epoxides is an attractive approach for valorizing waste products and improving sustainability in polymer manufacturing. Now, a heterodinuclear Mg(ii)Co(ii) complex has been shown to act as a highly active and selective catalyst for this reaction at low CO2 pressure. The synergy between the two metals was investigated using polymerization kinetics.},

Graphene has been proposed as an ideal electrode support material due to its corrosion resistance, high surface area and high conductivity. However, to date, graphene-based electrodes suffer from high defect concentrations and non-uniform nanoparticle coverage that negatively affects performance; moreover, production methods are difficult to scale. Herein we describe a scalable synthesis for Pt nanoparticle-coated graphene whereby PtCl2 is reduced directly by negatively charged single layer graphene sheets in solution. The resultant nanoparticles are of optimal dimensions and can be uniformly dispersed, yielding high catalytic activity, remarkable stability, and showing a much smaller decrease in electrochemical surface area compared with an optimised commercial catalyst over 30 000 cycles. The stability is rationalised by identical location TEM which shows minimal nanoparticle agglomeration and no nanoparticle detachment.},

A computational analysis of 2 reveals that coordination of ethene to uranium reduces the carbon-carbon bond order from two to a value consistent with a single bond, with a concomitant change in the formal uranium oxidation state from +3 in 1 to +4 in 2. Fur-thermore, the uranium-ethene bonding in 2 is of the $\delta$-type, with the dominant uranium contribution being from f/d hybrid orbitals. Complex 2 reacts with hydrogen to produce ethane and re-form 1, leading to the discovery that complex 1 also catalyzes the hydrogenation of ethene under ambient conditions.},

abstract = {Reduction of -diketiminato nickel(II) complexes (LtBuNiII) to the corresponding nickel(I) compounds does not require alkali metal compounds but can also be performed with the milder cobaltocenes. LtBuNiBr and Cp2Co have rather similar redox potentials, so that the equilibrium with the corresponding electron transfer compound [LtBuNiIBr][Cp2CoIII] (ETC) clearly lies on the side of the starting materials. Still, the ETC portion can be used to activate CO2 yielding a mononuclear nickel(II) carbonate complex and ETC can be isolated almost quantitatively from the solutions through crystallisation. The more negative reduction potential of Cp*2Co shifts the equilibrium formed with LtBuNiBr strongly towards the ETC and accordingly the reaction of such solutions with CO2 is much faster.},

@article{Ar2021,
abstract = {The heteroleptic (formazanato)nickel bromide complex LNi($\mu$-Br)2NiL [LH = Mes-NH-N=C(p-tol)-N=N-Mes] has been prepared by deprotonation of LH with NaH followed by reaction with NiBr2(dme). Treatment of this complex with KC8 led to transformation of the formazanate into azoiminate ligands via N-N bond cleavage and the simultaneous release of aniline. At the same time, the potentially resulting intermediate complex L′2Ni [L′ = HN=C(p-tol)-N=N-Mes] was reduced by one additional electron, which is delocalized across the $\pi$system and the metal center. The resulting reduced complex [L′2Ni]K(18-c-6) has a S = 1/2 ground state and a square-planar structure. It reacts with dioxygen via one-electron oxidation to give the complex L′2Ni, and the formation of superoxide was detected spectroscopically. If oxidizable substrates are present during this process, these are oxygenated/oxidized. Triphenylphosphine is converted to phosphine oxide, and hydrogen atoms are abstracted from TEMPO-H and phenols. In the case of cyclohexene, autoxidations are triggered, leading to the typical radical-chain-derived products of cyclohexene.},

abstract = {Organometallic complexes containing the 5-membered rings cyclopentadienyl or phospholyl as $\pi$-ligands (so-called metallocene complexes) with group 4 metals have been investigated for several decades with a sustained effort in the scientific community. Titanium, zirconium and hafnium compounds containing one, or two Cp rings (“half-sandwich” or “sandwich” complexes, respectively) and their phospholyl analogues have witnessed a widespread use in many application areas including organic synthesis, homogeneous catalysis and material science. The last two decades have seen a significant development of this research field, with new classes of sandwich and half-sandwich complex emerging, and particular applications in small molecule activation, dehydrocoupling reactions and polymerization catalysis. This article gives a detailed account of the research into cyclopentadienyl and phospholyl complexes with group 4 metals (Ti, Zr and Hf) over the period 2000–2020.},

@article{Mulcahy2021,
abstract = {Structural adhesives are commonly used to join dissimilar materials and are of particular interest in complex technological devices used in automotive, telecommunications, photonic devices, aerospace and sustainable power production and storage. Their strength, ease of application and stability are of significant help in the manufacture and service of the device, however, they can present significant issues at end of life, particularly when technology critical metals need to be recovered. In this paper, we highlight some of the issues, and discuss an alternative approach: the use of adhesives that can be debonded upon application of an external stimulus. The aim of this critical review is to consider the polymer systems which have been investigated and suggest some alternative strategies. It also aims to demonstrate the different stimuli that can be used to debond and critique the applicability of these with a number of case studies. Finally, the service conditions and process economics are considered together with a discussion of the Green benefits of this type of methodology.},
